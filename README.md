- 👋 Hi, I’m @dual-a
- 👀 I’m interested in software development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, c# and javascript (for react). I'm also learning a lot of the Microsft ecosystem including sharepoint, power platform and azure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with languages that fit my knowledge, so I can be useful.
